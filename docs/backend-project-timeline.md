## Critical Milestones

1. **Day 2**: Authentication system functional
2. **Day 5**: Core resume CRUD operations working
3. **Day 6**: AI integration complete
4. **Day 8**: Test coverage meets standards
5. **Day 10**: Production deployment complete

## Parallel Work Strategies

For accelerated execution, the following tasks can be performed in parallel:

1. **Database & API**: One team member can work on database models while another implements API endpoints
2. **Auth & Resume Management**: Split these components between team members
3. **Testing & Documentation**: Can be started as soon as the first endpoints are completed
4. **AI & Templates**: Can be worked on independently from core CRUD operations

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Setup
git clone <repo-url>
npm install
npm run setup:dev

# Development
npm run dev

# Testing
npm run test

# Build & Deploy
npm run build
npm run deploy
```
